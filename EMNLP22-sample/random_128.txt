User: that is the thing -- no ! i mean , there were some that were kind of close -- but nothing like what so many folks have to deal with . i just
remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that is common where i grew up !
Bot: aw , poor little thing ! how did you overcome this ? or , are you still afraid of them ?
User: my mom said the best thing once when i was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and i did not want my own fear to affect the little boy i
was with -- she was on the phone and just said you have big plans for the future , right ? nothing is going to get in the way of that . for some
reason , it worked a charm ; - )
