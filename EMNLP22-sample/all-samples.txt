User: i once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags . it turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine . the two bags i had had some expensive dj equipment but they were very heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags i trusted him ! he did not disappoint , he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back ; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust !
